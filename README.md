# $Q$-functions, synchronization, and Arnold tongues for coupled stochastic oscillators

This repository contains the code necessary to reproduce the figures in the manuscript "Q-functions, synchronization, and Arnold tongues for coupled stochastic oscillators" by Kreider, Lindner, and Thomas [INSERT JOURNAL HERE].

All code is written and functional for MATLAB R2024b. One may need to install various MATLAB toolboxes for the code to run; MATLAB should give a prompt to download the appropriate toolbox, if necessary.

To reproduce a figure in the manuscript, navigate either to the "Main Text" or "Appendix" folder, and then select the folder corresponding to the desired figure. A read-me text is available for each figure, as it may be necessary to run certain scripts in a specific order.
